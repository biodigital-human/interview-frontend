# Create a superhero listing

## Tasks

1. Create a two column layout. 

2. Fetch or include the `marvel.json` file.

3. Sort the heroes alphabetically in reverse.

4. In the left column, create a list of the heroes. It should contain their `name`, and 64px wide `thumbnail`.

5. When a hero is clicked, display a list of their `series`. Each list item should be the `name` linked to the `resourceURI`.

6. If there's time left, make it pretty!
